How are you?, I am sorry to write in english. because this computer is not  available in korean.

i am waiting for the next transit airplane right now because our flight are about to go to DHAKA at  6:05 PM

We departed from incheon airport at 10:05 AM. Our member are compsosed of 26 volunteers totally.

Even though my team are getting tired a little bit,  they are full of hope and intention to help others of Bangladesh.

We stay for about 5 hours at the airport.  In the meantime, i am writing to you.

Our medical instruments and medical drugs such as Ultrasound, EKG, Dental handpiece, compresseor and lots of medicine were passed at the Incheon airport fortunately.

Next step is that we should pass through the DHAKA airport safely.

I will send you next massage  when i have time to write you in Bangladesh..

I hope all of you come with us someday.

Good bye..
